Welcome to the **Global KVS Library** — an open-source platform designed to make **NCERT/CBSE books**, **interesting reads**, and **more educational content** freely available to everyone. It's fast, accessible, and built for the web, powered by the modern **Next.js** framework.

- Provide free and open access to government-published curriculum books (like NCERT), open-access materials, and community-curated gems

This is more than just a book viewer — it's a mission to make education **open, free, and borderless**.
